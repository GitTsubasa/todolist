- webpack bundles all the code into a smaller bundle,
-> then this bundle needs to be injected into index.html
-> this is done in the plugins of webpack 
  plugins: [
    new HTMLWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index/html'
    })
  ],

- webpack defaults to port 8080
- need try catch in the server because it doesn't catch 
the errors that are connecting from the db
- have more structures with errors
> add global error handler, add different error handler for specificity (add 500 error)
> add 404
> match the type of the request (ex: make sure it's a string)

- be particular about html tags
- avoid passing from parent to child as much as possible
- frontend is agnostic, don't update frontend info and backend at the same time
-> think as if you feeding information to frontend 
-> unidirectional data flow, starting from the database
